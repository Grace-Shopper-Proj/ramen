Team expectations
If you are frustrated, bring it up in morning meeting. If something is getting in the way of working during the day, slack to request a meeting to regroup and talk about it.
Merging and pull requests: Everyone will review the code before merging it in.
Asking for help: Assess whether it can be solved with resources within the group/online
After the pair has tried to solve it, ask for outside help. Don’t spend more than an hour on one issue.
Resolving disagreements: If an issue arises the other pair will help mediate
Decisions: For larger decisions make sure everyone has a chance to talk before we make the decision.

Pair programming
Decide with your pair on when to switch navigating vs. driving
Explain what you are doing to your pair

Working outside of class hours:
We may work in pairs outside of class hours, not alone
We may work on Saturday, will try not to work on Sunday.
Decide about lunch break with your pair. Try to at least take a 30 minute lunch break. If one person wants to take a break,take a break.
